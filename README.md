# Pinewood Interview Test
Interview task test for Pinewood Tech.

## Running
1. Build solution.
2. Run `PinewoodTest.API` project.
3. Run `PinewoodTest.Client` project.

I recommend multi-project launch directly from VS for best experience!

## Technical notes
- .NET 8 is required for running.
- Blazor is used for frontend so Blazor workloads might be necessary.
- Since the task specified it does not focus on UI design, I used [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) component library to make implementation of UI faster and less painful.
- Home page doesn't have pagination as I deemed it unnecessary for this test.
